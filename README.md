# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

## Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection project is a real-time system that monitors the driver's eye state to detect drowsiness. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the driver's facial features and determine whether their eyes are open or closed. If the driver is detected to be drowsy, an alarm is triggered to alert them.

## Features
- Real-time face and eye detection using Haar cascades.
- Eye state classification (open/closed) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Audio alarm to alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
- Score-based system to track the driver's eye state over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pygame
- imutils
- scipy
